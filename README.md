# stanCode-SC001: Programming Methodologies
Hey there! I’m Sidney Chen 👋✨
## 👩‍💻 About Me
In May 2022, I made a bold leap—from being a Junior High School Technology Teacher to pursuing my passion as an aspiring Cybersecurity Engineer. That's when I dove headfirst into Python through stanCode's comprehensive curriculum. It’s been a journey of growth, challenges, and plenty of "aha!" moments. 💡💻

## 💛 My Learning Journey
This repo is more than just code—it's a snapshot of my dedication and the skills I’ve built along the way. 💪

I’ve tackled 4 hands-on assignments that helped me level up in:

🔄 Loops & Conditions
🧮 Variables, Arithmetic, & Logic
🔤 String Manipulation & File Reading
🖼 Image Processing using SimpleImage
Every file here reflects my approach, thought process, and the little victories that made me a better coder. 🚀

📚 Assignments Overview:
- **Assignment 1:** Loops, Conditions, Functions
- **Assignment 2:** Variables, Input, Arithmetic, Logic
- **Assignment 3:** String Manipulation, File Reading

## 💻 About stanCode 001
The backbone of my Python journey is stanCode, founded by Stanford MSc. grad Jerry. His mission? To make Stanford-level CS education accessible to all students in Taiwan—no matter their background.

stanCode 001 draws inspiration from Stanford’s renowned CS106A, laying down a strong foundation in programming, critical thinking, and problem-solving. It’s where I learned to code not just for machines, but for people. 💖
