## 💻 About stanCode 001
The backbone of my Python journey is stanCode, founded by Stanford MSc. grad Jerry. His mission? To make Stanford-level CS education accessible to all students in Taiwan—no matter their background.

stanCode 001 draws inspiration from Stanford’s renowned CS106A, laying down a strong foundation in programming, critical thinking, and problem-solving. It’s where I learned to code not just for machines, but for people. 💖
